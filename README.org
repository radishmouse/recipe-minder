** Adding recipes and modifications

*** TODO I need to add a recipe

- add a recipe to the db
- add ingredients, one at a time
  - first see if they are already in the =ingredients= table
  - then add to the =amounts= table (effectively linking ingredients to recipe)
- for each instruction ("step"), add to the =steps= table


*** I need to record the fact that I made a recipe

- create an entry in the =meals= table
- for each recipe that was part of the meal, link in =recipes_meals= table

*** TODO I need to tag a recipe

*** TODO I just made a thing, and next time, I want to try making it spicier

*** TODO Oh, I don't like this new version. I want to go back to that thing I did a few times ago.

** Advanced querying

*** TODO What have I not made in a while for a party that has beets in it?
